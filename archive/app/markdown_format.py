"""Markdown text reflow for Bitbucket comments.

Bitbucket comments render LLM free-text prose as one continuous paragraph that
runs the full browser width, which is hard to read on wide monitors. We hard-wrap
that prose at a fixed column so no line runs full width.

Bitbucket Data Center's CommonMark renderer treats a single newline inside a
paragraph as a visible line break (verified empirically against the target
instance), so ``HARD_BREAK`` is just ``"\\n"``. If a future instance needs a
different break token (e.g. ``"  \\n"`` two trailing spaces, or ``"\\\\\\n"``
backslash), change it here — it is the single point of control.

A forced break the renderer cannot undo will double-wrap on views narrower than
``WRAP_WIDTH`` (mobile, side-by-side diff). That trade-off is accepted: the goal
is to cap line width, not graceful reflow. A single unbreakable token (URL,
``path/to/file``) is left to overflow rather than being chopped, so the cap is a
target, not an absolute guarantee.

Idempotency and the structural pass-through both assume ``HARD_BREAK == "\\n"``
(``wrap_prose`` re-splits on ``"\\n"``, exactly reversing the join). Changing
``HARD_BREAK`` to a multi-char token requires updating the splitter accordingly.

Re-wrapping is idempotent with one bounded exception: a list-item continuation
line consisting solely of a single token wider than the column (e.g. a bare long
URL) loses its hang-indent on a second pass, because on re-entry such a line is
indistinguishable from plain prose and ``textwrap`` drops the leading indent.
This is cosmetic (content and code spans are untouched) and unreached in
practice — every caller wraps fresh model output exactly once.

# unpadded placeholder is far shorter than the span and makes lines overflow).
